# Analysis Tools

General purpose modules useful for various analyses.

The main feature of `ROOTmanager.py` is the `TreeProcess` class which helps clean up a lot of repetative code often found in analysis code. There are plans to add a function/class to move the whole process to a scratch directory for working with larger collections of ROOT files.

`eventDisplay.py` is provided as an example of how `ROOTmanager` is intended to be used.
